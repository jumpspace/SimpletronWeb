Simpletron Machine Language (SML). Based on Deitel's Java How To Program 6th Ed. 
This started as a programming exercise in a book. I have rewritten it in Javascript, with the input/output in HTML. 

This project produces a simplified simulation of a machine language interpreter. Details on how this machine language interpreter should work are detailed in the "Java How To Program 6th Edition" book. 
This is my initial attempt at taking a concept meant for one programming language and re-implementing it in another.
